## PR-Previews

### How is a PR-Preview created?
Every Pull Request in to the Main Branch will automatically create a viewable deployment environment on Heroku.


### Where to find the Deployment link?
After a pull request has been created, you will find a button "View Deployment" at the end of the commit chain, which will redirect you to the deployment environment from Heroku.

A PR-Preview has a life span of 30 days after the last commit on the branch that will be merged in to the Main branch.
